Person re-ID can be viewed as an image retrieval problem. Given one query image in Camera **A**, we need to find the images of the same person in other Cameras. The key of the person re-ID is to find a discriminative representation of the person. Many recent works apply deep learning to extract visual features, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

This practical explores the basic of learning pedestrian features. In this pratical, we will learn to build a simple person re-ID system step by step.
